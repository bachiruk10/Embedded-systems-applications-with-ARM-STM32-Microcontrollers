# Application: ADC_DMA_MultiChannel_UART_ interface with Python

	/***************************** Application tags ******************************
	 ADC triggered by timer
	 UART data communication to PC
	 Python for control STM32 and reading/ plotting data
	 **************************************************************************/

	/* *************************************************************************
	* Application: ADC_DMA_MultiChannel_UART_ interface with Python
	*

    Form a project with the following specification:

    Configure STM32F4 to read data from 3 potentiometers. ADC data is triggered using
    appropriate timer at a frquency of 10 Hz (10 samples/second). Data is transfered in real time to Python
    for plotting. Also configure Python to send character "g" via UART to
    for the ADC to start acquiring data, or "r" to stop the ADC. Use animated plot on Python to plot
    updated data frames of 50 digitised ADC samples.
    Green led will be toggled every time a sample is taken by the ADC
    Red led will be turned on when ADC is started by Python and turned off when ADC stops
